		<p>My name is Darius, I'm an Iranian-American born and raised in Northern Virginia. I graduated from Virginia Tech in 2011 with a degree in Business Management. Since then I've found my self working in the Automotive Industry where I've spent the last 4 years working as an employee of Volkswagen Group's Headquarters in Herndon, VA. My experience within the automotive industry initially encompassed data analytics reporting. In 2016 I was offered a position to serve on Audi's mobility department where our team's mission was to strategize the company's placement within the rapidly exanding world of alternative transportation. It was within this role, in working with some of our partners in silicon valley and Austin, TX, that I saw the potential for an understanding in full stack development.</p>
